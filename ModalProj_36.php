				As an UBC Alumni, this project is particularly close to our heart. I mean, Boulevard was practically started at UBC. If it wasn't by fate that the founder decided to take on the AMS position of Director of Student Discounts, would he had gone on to be a doctor or engineer? <br><br>
It's great to be connected to our Alma Mater - this world class University, and be a part of Imagine UBC.
